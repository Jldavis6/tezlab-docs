This value is calculated on select charges and recorded over time. \n\nIn order to get the most accurate extrapolation possible and to avoid charting normal fluctuations, TezLab estimates battery capacity on charging sessions where a significant amount of energy has been added to the battery (minimum 25%) and where the ending state of charge is 90% or greater. For example, a charge from 65-91% will trigger a max range estimate calculation.",

This can contribute positively to your carbon impact by helping to offset carbon produced through your daily activities (like charging your car). Trees also have many other benefits, like absorbing and retaining rainwater in urban areas, as well as economic and health benefits that can help improve lives.",

At that time, we will send you a confirmation email & receipt for your purchase. Whenever possible, we will let you know where your tree will be planted in your confirmation. Periodically, we will release a report on our community tree planting progress and we'll be sure to keep everyone who contributes in the loop.",

            "feeA": "Yes, TezLab collects a small fee, in part to help cover 3rd party payment processing charges. Since our payment processing fees are proportionate, we pass savings on by implementing lower per-tree prices for larger orders."
